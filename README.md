# Ring

Ring is a Clojure web applications library inspired by Python's WSGI
and Ruby's Rack. By abstracting the details of HTTP into a simple,
unified API, Ring allows web applications to be constructed of modular
components that can be shared among a variety of applications, web
servers, and web frameworks.

The [SPEC][1] file at the root of this distribution provides a
complete description of the Ring interface.
